# SCOPE



The scope of this project is to create a website using Python Django framework, tailored to showcase a diverse collection of authentic African recipes.

Key features will include:

**User Authentication:** The website will use the Django AllAuth library to enable user account creation and login functionality. Once registered and logged in, users gain access to the website's full suite of features.

**Recipe Management:** Registered users will have the capability to contribute their own recipes. Additionally, they can update their recipes over time to keep the content fresh and relevant.

**User Engagement:** Users can express their appreciation for recipes by liking them. They can also express their dislikes if a particular recipe does not align with their taste.

**Recipe Deletion:** Registered users will have the ability to delete their own recipes, providing them with control over their contributed content.

**Country-Based Navigation:** The website will offer a user-friendly way for visitors to search recipes from specific African countries. Users can either click on a country's name or utilize the dropdown menu featuring a list of african countries.

By implementing these features, 'Mama's Kitchen' aims to foster an engaging community for African food enthusiasts, where users can share, discover, and appreciate the rich heritage of African kitchen.
